# Simple Nmap Bash Scanner

A simple bash script to perform Nmap scanning on a target IP or domain. This tool allows users to run a ping scan, a full port scan, and OS/service detection.

## Features
- Ping Scan to check if the host is up.
- Full Port Scan (all 65535 ports).
- OS and Service Detection.

## Requirements
- `nmap`: Make sure Nmap is installed on your system. You can install it by running:

  For **Debian-based** systems (like Ubuntu/Kali Linux):
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nmap
